Not everyone has the budget to hire a cover designer for their book, however if you do have the funds required but just aren’t sure whether to spend the money or try to make the cover yourself, here I’ll show you why having a professional make your cover for you is a good idea!

Everyone has heard the saying ‘don’t judge a book by its cover’, however those in the publishing industry would have to disagree. A well done and effective book cover design should not only look nice on the book shelf, but should clearly tell the reader the title, signify the genre, and draw in the correct audience you want for your book. Design is absolutely essential to not only the aesthetics of your book, but also the success of your sales. As an author your cover design is not something to dismiss.

A professional cover designer is always worth the money, as they will use their own cultivated style to make sure your book communicates everything it needs to whilst standing out in the market. They will work with you to make your vision come to life, or if you don’t even know where to start they can show you a design which uses their knowledge of genre conventions and trends within book covers, to give your book that extra special quality that will appeal to the mass market.

There are also many practical considerations which as someone knew to cover design you won’t be aware of, such as bleedlines, using the right colour mode which will work for the book printers, converting your cover to an e-book version whilst retaining the visual appeal, dimensions for your book covers and more.

A professional cover designer will always be thinking of more ways to get the most out of your cover. For example, how would you use your cover for advertisement or merchandise, or as a header for your website? If you want to write a whole series of books can you use this design as the basis for all the future books?

If you hire a designer they will be able to help you with all these considerations, and even more questions which you hadn’t even thought about. 

## Where can you hire an affordable but professional cover designer?

Indie publishing sites are a good resource if you’re looking for a cheaper but professional service. Here are a few of options if this is what you’re looking for:

* [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/design/book-designer) is an indie publishing hub which offers free advice on topics such as editing, design, marketing, publicity, ghostwriting and websites. Not only do they offer a service which connects you with good quality book designers, but they also answer many questions you may have about the publishing process through their free to read blog site.
* [Indie Book Launcher ](https://indiebooklauncher.com/)can connect you with many publishing industry professionals, covering services such as editing, art and design, and general publishing services.
* [The Cat Agency ](https://catagencyinc.com/)is a brilliant website if you’re looking to have an illustrated cover. They have hundreds of artists to choose from, all at reasonable rates.
* [Beehive Illustrators ](https://www.beehiveillustration.com/)is another company you can hire illustrators from, however they specialise in children’s fiction and non-fiction illustrations. This site would be perfect for you if you're looking to make your children’s book fun and engaging.
* Social Media is an amazing resource for finding independent artists. While it may take a little longer to find the perfect person who fits your cover,  and who has the time to dedicate to you, it’s possible to find a real bargain from new artists looking to showcase their work at a cheaper price. Have a look at sites such as Twitter, Instagram or FaceBook to find the perfect designer for you.
* [Fivver](https://www.fiverr.com/) is a freelance website which connects you with people all over the world looking to sell their services. Whilst it isn’t as reliably good quality as other publishing sites who can guarantee the quality of all their designers, there are many professional designers to be found on freelance websites such as Fivver. If you're working with a smaller budget, this may be a good pick for you.

## How much does hiring a designer cost?

The price of your cover design relies completely on what you want on your cover. According to the Indie Publishing site Reedsy, 

> “A professional book cover designer typically costs about $500-$800 for a single project. However, a simpler cover from a less-experienced designer would cost less, while an elaborate cover would cost quite a bit more.”- [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/design/book-cover-design)

However, if you want to use a specific stock photo you’ve found, or want an original illustrated cover the price will again vary. The publishing site BookBeaver says,

“Generally speaking a cover based on stock images and photo manipulation will cost between £270 - £450. Book covers based on illustrations can cost anything from £500 - £1300 depending on the complexity of the artwork.”-[BookBeaver](https://www.bookbeaver.co.uk/blog/book-cover-design-costs)

Essentially, like any other expenses you come across in the publishing process, the cost will vary depending on a number of factors, including your personal preferences and your available budget. However, unlike other costs, the decision to hire a professional book cover designer should be at the top of your list. Kevin Tumlinson in his article [The Psychology of a Good Book Cover](https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/the-psychology-of-a-good-book-cover/) says this:

> “Your cover is its own story, and readers are looking at it as a way to help them make a purchasing and reading decision.”

If you want your book to sell, it needs to tell the readers exactly what they want to see. You need to indicate things like the genre, theme, events of the book, and action, all whilst keeping it looking professional. You want your book to make readers think that:

> “you have the resources and the means to do this work at a standard above the hobby level, and you have the kind of respect for your readers that empowers, enables, and compels you to give them your best.”- [Tumlinson](https://www.draft2digital.com/blog/the-psychology-of-a-good-book-cover/)

If your book cover looks cheaply done and bad, then readers will associate this with the quality of your book overall. Essentially, you want readers to take away from their first glance at your book that it is professional, well done and exciting.





Overall, the answer to my question at the beginning ‘Should you hire a book cover designer?’ will always be YES. However, obviously not everyone has that high of a budget for their book. But don’t worry, this is what my website is here for!
