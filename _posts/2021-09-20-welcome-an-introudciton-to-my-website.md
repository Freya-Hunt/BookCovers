> **‘Novels press forward, seeking to allure the passing browser. They also challenge and liberate the designer to suggest through the cover not merely what the contents of the book might be, but also what might be its special qualities, its singular imaginative space’**- Mullan 2003, Guardian. 



My dissertation supervisor Leander Reeves at Oxford Brookes University once told me that when people look at  your book cover, their initial impression of what your book is about is formed in their minds within three seconds. Within these sparse few moments you need to grip their attention, and keep it. They need to be told the genre, themes, action, tone, and anything else you want them to know about your book all within their first glance, or you run the risk of people passing your book by, seeing it as another bland and generic novel that they won't be interested in. 

 

*But how do you convey all this information within just three seconds?*

 

This is where great book design comes in. If you as an author want your book to compete in the marketplace with bestselling novels, you need to have a professionally designed and stunning cover that can convey all these things. As Mullan says, your cover is your own ‘singular imaginative space’, and you have a single glance to show readers how your book is special.

However, not all authors know about design, how to hire illustrators, how to use design software, what looks good on a cover and what doesn’t. If you’re working by yourself to self-publish your book, then you may even lack the funds to hire a professional designer. 

This got me thinking- if authors backed by big publishing houses have access to professional designers who know all the secrets behind book cover design and how to instantly convey to a reader what their books are about, then how is the average author with limited funds meant to compete with their own book covers? 

This website was built with the intention to give book design novices a hub of information about all aspects of book cover design, from what typefaces look good on your cover, to the dimensions you should use for your book. I have collected a massive amount of information sourced from academic texts, book design websites, data archives and first-hand research from bestselling bookstores. As well as a myriad of articles about book design theory, I have also made beginner friendly tutorials for design and formatting software, as well as guides on how to source photos and illustrations for your cover. In addition to this, I have curated lists of top selling books according to genre from the last five years, and have made articles breaking down genre specific design tropes, meaning you can make something both trendy, unique, and professional. 

My introductory posts will give you a brief overview of book design, including basic theories on things such as design, layout and typography, as well as showing you how to hire an affordable book cover designer, and also a massive collection of other resources you can use to find inspiration for your cover. 



***I hope this website helps to bring out the creative designer within you, and gives you the tools you need to create something both stunning and unique!***
