Sometimes it’s hard to know where to start when it comes to design, and when dealing with a project as personal as a book you’ve put energy and passion into writing, you're going to want a cover as unique and stunning as the book itself.

Here I’ll show you some amazing resources and articles for inspiration which will for sure ignite your creative spark!

## Book Cover Archive: 

The [Book Cover Archive](http://bookcoverarchive.com/) is an amazing resource and should be a first stop for anyone new to book design. It features a massive gallery of the best book design in the industry, and no matter your genre you're bound to find hundreds of sources of inspiration for your cover here.

## Stock Photography: 

Stock photography can be a massive source of inspiration, and there are many book cover specific stock websites which feature character shots as well as genre specific photography, making it extremely useful for cover designers.
