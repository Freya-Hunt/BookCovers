Looking to make a unique and trendy young adult fiction book cover, but have no idea where to start? This guide will walk through the current trends of this genre and show you how to make a genre appropriate design. I will also show you the easiest and most useful design software available, that even a novice at design could use to create both a professional and stunning cover.



# Current trends in young adult fiction covers



### Illustrated cover



If you take a look at the young adult fiction section in any bookstore, something you are bound to notice is how almost all the books are illustrated. From super detailed fantasy epic covers, to more simple fun cartoonish covers for high school romance novels, these covers all feature stunning and unique illustrations. Take a look at these pictures of the young adult book section in Oxford Blackwells for an example of how varied the style of art used in this genre is.

If you plan to illustrate your own cover, try looking at other books within the genre to know what types of colour palettes, art styles and imagery are popular. Also check out my post here about how you can **illustrate your own cover as a novice- for free!** 

Additionally, have a look at this super handy [article by Matthew Macdonald ](https://writingcooperative.com/how-to-illustrate-your-book-for-0-e1a5fe89375d)if you want to use image manipulation to create your own original illustrated cover.



However, not all of us have the skills to create original illustrations, and sometimes things like these are best left to professionals unless you want to risk ending up with something unintentionally bad.
