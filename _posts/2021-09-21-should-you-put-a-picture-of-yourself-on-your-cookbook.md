It can be an awkward question to ask, should you put a picture of yourself on your front cover? 

Julie Karen from the indie publishers website[ JulieKaren.com](https://www.juliekaren.com/blog/should-my-photo-be-on-the-front-cover-of-my-book) says that: 

> “This week a client of mine who is self-publishing a cookbook wrote to me with this question: Should my photo be on the front cover of my book? Everybody says yes....\[but I am not sure.]"

Her reply to the client was this:

> “Having your face on your book's front cover is atypical in your genre.”

Whilst some cook-books feature the chef or baker on the cover, newly emerging food genres such as clean eating vegan cookbooks, or student cookbooks, do not.

> “Sometimes having an atypical cover can make your cover win, but often it can make it lose. The decision to make an atypical cover needs to be a decision made for a deliberate marketing reason.”- [Karen](https://www.juliekaren.com/blog/should-my-photo-be-on-the-front-cover-of-my-book)

Whilst it is essential to be aware of the trends of book covers for your books genre, your final choice depends a lot on your branding decision. For example, if you want your cookbooks to be about you, your personality and look, then it might work well to put your face on the cover to start building your brand with you as the focus. However, if your marketing does not feature your face, and focuses more on photos of the food you’re featuring in the book, it would probably be a better move to do the same for your book cover. Having your face on the cover will not benefit sales or the branding of your book if the people you’re selling your book to aren’t aware of what you look like in the first place.

But don’t just take my work for it. Here are two answers to similar questions from experts in the publishing field I found online, which I thought would be insightful to show here.

[This insight](https://www.selfpublishedauthor.com/content/8-mistakes-will-absolutely-kill-your-book) is from Hobie Hobart, an indie publishing blogger:

> *'Is it ever a good idea to put your picture on a book cover?'*
>
> *'*This is contingent on many factors so the initial answer is, it depends. It IS a good idea, and nearly mandatory, to use your picture on the front cover if you are a Barack Obama, an Oprah, or a renowned superstar. Many authors think that putting their picture on the front cover will make them famous. This is not necessarily so. Unless you are well known in the media, bookstore buyers will not accept your book which pictures you on the front cover. However, if you are selling exclusively to a tight niche where you are well known, or your intention is to start branding yourself to a specific market, your photo on the front cover or the spine can be an advantage.'

This is how [Michele DeFilippo](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michele-DeFilippo), an indie publishing expert, answered this question:

> *'Should I put my own photo on my book cover?* '
>
> 'It depends. If YOU are the product, then your picture can absolutely be used on the front cover (think Dr. Phil or Suze Orman). If your book is non-fiction, you are a well-known expert in your field, and buyers would recognize your face, then your picture can be used on the back cover, along with a bio. Otherwise, your picture and bio belong in the back matter of the book.'

Ultimately the answer is not a definite yes or no, as the more realistic answer is that it depends. More often than not for an indie or self-publishing author the answer is no, however if you think it’s essential for your marketing and branding to have your face on your cover, then why not try it out!
