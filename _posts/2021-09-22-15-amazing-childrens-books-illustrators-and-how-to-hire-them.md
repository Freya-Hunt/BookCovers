However, with this massive marketplace comes a huge oversaturation of books- if you want your book to stand out in the sea of children’s fiction, you’ll need to have a colorful, fun and engaging cover that will draw children to your book. 

Children’s books are a space for imagination and creativity, and many times what makes these books magical are the illustrators behind them.

Whether you want to hire a children’s illustrator to create a fantastical cover for your children’s book, or you want them to decorate each page with engaging artwork, this list will help you decide who you want to hire.

We can all remember children’s book illustrators that stood out to us as kids. For some it’s the simplistic colourful style of Jacqueline Wilson, and for others it's the calming and gentle watercolours of Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit. The best illustrators not only helped us imagine our favourite worlds, but also made us fall in love with the memorable characters and beautiful stories being told.

Whilst many children’s books are both written and illustrated by the author, it is also common for the author to hire an illustrator to help them imagine the world they’re creating. If this is where you’re currently at, with an idea for a children’s book but no way to illustrate your cover or the pages, I want to help you with the task of bringing your story to life. So which illustrator should you hire that will create the perfect combination of your writing and their images?

In this post, I’ll show you 15 of the best children’s book illustrators you can find in the industry today, and show you exactly how you can hire them. If you’re ready to plunge into a magical world of colour and imagination let's begin!
