Here I will answer common questions people new to design may have, as well as provide many links to free design resources, showing you want tools are available to you as a novice book cover designer. 



## Anatomy of the book cover

The book cover, or dust jacket for hardcover books, includes three parts:

* The front cover- Title, author, illustration/photo, subtitle, tagline
* The spine- Book title, authors name, illustration
* **The back cover- Book summary, endorsement/reviews, illustrations, barcode, price**

## What are the standard dimensions of book covers? 

The dimensions of your book can change depending on what size book you want to create, or what shape. For example, some hardback books are much larger than standard, and some children’s books or non-fiction books come in non-standard shapes, such as square instead of rectangular. However, there are sizes which are standard for the industry. Check out these useful articles which explain all the book dimensions used within book publishing, to see which is right for you.

## How much does it cost to hire a book cover designer?

The publishing agency [Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/) claims that:

> “Budget naturally plays a role in an indie author’s publishing decisions. On our marketplace, [p](https://reedsy.com/design/book-designer)rofessional designers charge, on average, $650 to design a book cover. However, roughly 20% of the designers we polled [](https://blog.reedsy.com/cost-to-self-publish-a-book/#cover)will charge under $400 — and if you manage to find a super-talented newbie who can do a simple design, it might be even less.”- [Reedsy](https://blog.reedsy.com/book-cover-design-software/)

The design website [Book Beaver](https://www.bookbeaver.co.uk/) also says that:

> “Generally speaking a cover based on stock images and photo manipulation will cost between £270 - £450. Book covers based on illustrations can cost anything from £500 - £1300 depending on the complexity of the artwork.”- [Book Beaver](https://www.bookbeaver.co.uk/blog/book-cover-design-costs)

However, understandably not everyone has this high of a budget to go towards their cover. Don’t worry, this is what my website is here for!
